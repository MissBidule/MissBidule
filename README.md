### Hi and welcome to my profile üòä

My real name is Lilou ALIDOR and MissBidule is my alias for all my creative stuff.
At the moment, I am in an Erasmus semester abroad for my studies in the engineer school called [IMAC](https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/) where I'm studying art and computer science.

These are some informations about me :

- üíª I'm currently looking for an internship as a game developer
- üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª I've learned C++, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, Assembly, FORTRAN, OpenGL, ThreeJs... and more
- üí≠ I want to become a Video Game developper
- ‚ù§Ô∏è I love the C++ language, video games, art, originality and creating stuff
- ü§î I think programming is a form of art

Here are some projects I've worked on the past few years :  

My little cube world : [repo](https://github.com/MissBidule/OpenGL_TPs_S4)  
Technologies : C++, OpenGL, Open Asset Import Library  
A duo project to experiment with 3D models, shadows, animations and shaders with OpenGL.  
I made most of the project, from the models to the water and animation movements using Blender and the Assimp library.
