### Hi and welcome to my profile 😊

My real name is Lilou ALIDOR and MissBidule is my alias for all my creative stuff.
At the moment, I am in an engineer school called [IMAC](https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/) where I'm studying art and computer science.

These are some informations about me :

- 💻 I'm currently working on a Unity(to be confirmed) school project 
- 👩🏽‍💻 I've learned C++, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, Assembly, FORTRAN, OpenGL, ThreeJs... and more
- 💭 I want to become a Video Game developper
- ❤️ I love the C++ language, video games, art, originality and creating stuff
- 🤔 I think programming is a form of art

Here are some projects I've worked on the past few years :
