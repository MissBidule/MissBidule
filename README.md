### Hi and welcome to my profile 😊

My real name is Lilou ALIDOR and MissBidule is my alias for all my creative stuff.
At the moment, I am in an engineer school called [IMAC](https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/) where I'm studying art and computer science.

These are some informations about me :

- 💻 I'm currently working on a Unity(to be confirmed) school project 
- 👩🏽‍💻 I've learned C++, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, Assembly, FORTRAN, OpenGL, ThreeJs... and more
- 💭 I want to become a Video Game developper
- ❤️ I love the C++ language, video games, art, originality and creating stuff
- 🤔 I think programming is a form of art

Here are some projects I've worked on the past few years :  

Pokimac : [repo](https://github.com/MissBidule/Pokimac)  
Language : C, C++, SDL  
A pokemon like.  
I've done all the SDL part and animation of the sprite. Using the code my teammate had done to optimize it and harmonize it with the code.

Childchemy : [repo](https://github.com/MissBidule/Childchemy) [demo](https://just-kiel.itch.io/childchemy)  
Language : JavaScript  
A GameJam game about mixing things.  
I made the drag and drop part of the project in order to "mix" items.

Food vs Humanity : [repo](https://github.com/MissBidule/Food-vs-Humanity)  
Language : C++, SDL, OpenGL  
A game of simple food blocks getting eaten by mouths.  
I made all the implementation and the base game to link OpenGL with the SDL2 lib, and created the datas for the levels (collision and stuff).

Food vs Humanity : no repo  
Language : Java  
An educational game to teach kids how to draw.  
This was a solo project, so I did all by myself using NetBeans.
